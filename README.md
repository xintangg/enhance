## ENHANCE: Accurate denoising of single-cell RNA-Seq data

This repository contains a Python implementation of the ENHANCE algorithm ([Wagner et al., 2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/655365v1)) for denoising single-cell RNA-Seq data.

More documentation and an R documentation will be published shortly!
